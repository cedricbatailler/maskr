maskr
====================

[![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/maskr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maskr) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cedricbatailler/maskr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cedricbatailler/maskr)

## Installation

Development version from Github:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("cedricbatailler/maskr")
```

## What does it do ?

According to Wicherts et al. (2016), insufficient blinding during the data anaysis phase is considered as one of the numerous *degrees of freedom* researchers have during the design, collection, analysis and report of psychological studies. They say:

> "It is surprising that blinding to conditions and hypotheses of experimenters, coders, and observers is considered to be crucial during data collection, while in practice, the analyses are typically conducted by a person who is not only aware of the hypotheses, but also benefits directly from corroborating them (commonly by means of a significance test). Together with the many researcher DFs during the analyses, these factors do not entail the most optimal mix for objective and unbiased results."

One suggestion to prevent such biases would be then to divide data collection and data analysis between two persons: an experimenter, and a data analyst. However, this solution is costly and can not always be realised in practice. Another solution would be to use a tool that allows the experimenter to blind himself during the analysis stage.

That's what `maskr` is for.

## How to use it ?

We use below the `mtcars` dataset. Consider that we are interested in the effects of the number of cylinders `cyl` on fuel consumption. We then would like to conduct our analyses while being blind to the values of this specific column.

``` r
library(maskr)
data(mtcars)
mtcars_encrypted <- encrypt(mtcars, cyl)
```

We can then conduct our analyses as planned with the encrypted dataframe...

``` r
model = lm(mpg ~ cyl, mtcars_encrypted)
summary(model)
```

Interestingly, when we output the summary of this model (or plot data), the original names are diplayed (feature)...
